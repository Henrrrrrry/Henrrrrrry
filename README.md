### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hongyu (Henry) Li, a passionate Computer Science student at The Australian National University (ANU). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with First Class Honours at RMIT University. My final year project, which was based on machine learning, software construction and Python programming, sparked my interest in programming. 

With a strong foundation in software development, I specialize in Android app development, and web development. My projects include utilizing Python for data augmentation and audio spectrum visualization, developing a safety-focused dwelling mapping app, and creating a web-based game for feeding a kitten that also provides real-world pet care tips.

### Skills:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, C++
- **Technologies:** Android Development, Web Development, Google Maps API, Unit&Instrumented Testing, Design Patterns, Tokenizer&Parser, Computer Networks, Computer Graphics, Data Structures
- **Tools:** GitHub, GitLab, CATIA, SolidWorks, Blender, MySQL

### Projects:
- **My Dwelling:** Developed an Android app to map seismic levels and provide fire alarm notifications.
- **S&R Noise Classification:** Implemented machine learning techniques to classify S&R noises with data augmentation and audio visualization.
- **Kitten Feeding Game:** Created a web-based game about feeding a kitten, offering real-world tips for taking care of a pet cat.

I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
